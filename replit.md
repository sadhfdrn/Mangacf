## System Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Entry Point**: Single `index.js` file serves as the main application entry point
- **Runtime Environment**: JavaScript (likely Node.js based)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Simple script execution model

### Design Decisions
- **Minimal Setup**: No build tools, frameworks, or complex configuration
- **Direct Execution**: Straightforward script that can be run directly with a JavaScript runtime
- **No Dependencies**: Zero external packages or libraries

## External Dependencies

Currently, this project has no external dependencies, third-party services, or integrations. It operates as a standalone JavaScript file that only relies on the basic JavaScript runtime environment.
