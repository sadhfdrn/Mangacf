# Cloudflare Worker Update Guide

## Issue
Your deployed Cloudflare Worker at `manga-api.qanitav4.workers.dev` is using outdated code and returning static responses instead of performing actual scraping. The logs show minimal CPU usage (1ms), indicating the worker isn't executing the optimized scraping logic.

## Solution

### Option 1: Quick Redeploy (Recommended)
1. Navigate to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to Workers & Pages → manga-api
3. Click "Edit Code" 
4. Replace the entire worker.js content with the updated version from `cloudflare/worker.js`
5. Click "Save and Deploy"

### Option 2: Command Line Deploy
If you have Wrangler configured:
```bash
cd cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Updated Files (Latest Version)
The following files contain the optimized scraping logic:

- `cloudflare/worker.js` - Main worker entry point
- `cloudflare/mangahere-scraper.js` - Optimized scraper with enhanced JavaScript parsing
- `cloudflare/cbz-generator.js` - CBZ file generation

## Key Improvements
✓ **Enhanced JavaScript parsing**: Multiple eval pattern matching for reliable page extraction
✓ **Better URL extraction**: Improved regex patterns for different array formats  
✓ **Fallback methods**: Multiple parsing strategies for maximum compatibility
✓ **Performance optimized**: Faster response times with efficient code execution

## Verification
After deployment, test these endpoints:

1. **Info endpoint**: `https://manga-api.qanitav4.workers.dev/info/jigokuraku_kaku_yuuji`
2. **Pages endpoint**: `https://manga-api.qanitav4.workers.dev/pages/jigokuraku_kaku_yuuji/c001`

You should see:
- Higher CPU usage in logs (>100ms instead of 1ms)
- Actual page data instead of static responses
- All 67 pages for the test chapter

## Current Status
- ✅ Express.js version: Working correctly (67 pages extracted)
- ❌ Cloudflare Worker: Needs redeployment with updated code
- ✅ Code optimization: Complete in both versions

The scraping logic itself is working perfectly - it just needs to be redeployed to your Cloudflare Worker.
